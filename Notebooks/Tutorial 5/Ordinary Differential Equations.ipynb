    "Differential equations are systems whose variables change with time. Mathematically, differentials are functions that contain derivatives of itself. When these systems are integrated, they provide analytical  functions that are dependent with time. Integration of differentials can be performed by calculus, or numerically. \n",

    "Ordinary differential equations (ODES) are equations that have a single dependent variables. Partial differential equations are equations that are dependent on 2 or more variables. Furthermore, the order of a differential equation is characterized by the highest derivative of an independent variable. \n",

    "Biological cell growth is a first order differential that describes the exponential increase of biomass concentration  (X) accumulation over time (assuming $ \\mu _g  $  is constant ). \n",
